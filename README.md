Simple rust script to go through your linkedin history and find the recruiters that have provided you with relevant job specs.

## Prerequisite

- Have rust and cargo installed on your machine:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## How to use

- Clone the repo
- rename .env.example to .env and fill in the required fields
- rename requirements.example.txt into requirements.txt and specify the requirements for the job you want to hear about
- Download your "messages.csv" file from linkedin, you can do so here: https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/download-my-data
  (only select messages)
- Place the file in src/data/messages.csv
- Run the following command:

```
cargo run
```

## Output
- The output is in the logs (make sure to use a terminal that has unlimited buffer like Warp), you will receive a list of recruiters with a score attached to each
- the score is the number of time they sent a message containg a relevant offer
- you'll also have a summary of the offers for each recruiter
- before the final output, you can see the response of OpenAI for each recruiter.
